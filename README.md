    2. cd into kb-tools
    3. Set configurations in `configs`
    4. ./setup-kb-local-repo.sh
    5. ./create-article.sh -q "What is kb-tools?"
    6. Write "or paste" your article, add attachments directory manually and fill with any needed attachments, then close editor when article is done

### FILES
    configs  
      Stores all user specific configs.  
      Currently Author, Visability setting, Repo, and Upstream Repo.  
    
      *Todo: Visability will eventually be moved to an option for the main script.*
    
    
    create-article.sh  
      Takes an option to choose the article category and a title for the article, encapsulated in quotes.  
      It will refresh the repo, create a feature branch, create the necessary directory, create 
      \_\_article\_\_.yaml, copy in the appropriate article template and opens it in your default editor.
      
      **Note: you should add your attachments manually while writing the article or just remember to run
      `git add` for the directory before commiting and pushing**  
    
      *Todo: I plan on moving that to the config so you can choose your editor or leave it to use the default terminal.*  
    
      After you close the editor, `create-article.sh` will add the article's directory to your staging area,
      output commands you can copy and run directly in the terminal to comit and push your article to `origin`.  
    
    
    reset-to-upstream.sh  
      Reset your master branch to upstream and clear the slate for the next article.  
      Fetches upstream, checks out master, rests to upstream/master, pushes to origin master,
      git clean -fd to clear untracked files and folders
    
    setup-kb-local-repo.sh  
      Clones your Fork of the repo and sets upstream.  Refers to `configs` file for repo locations.
